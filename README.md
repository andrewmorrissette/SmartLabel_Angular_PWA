# SmartLabelPWAv3

This project was an ongoing research project for the Michigan State Univeristy Broad Art Museum. Due to COVID-19 research funding was re-allocated and this specific project was stopped. 

Code runs via Angular/ Bootstrap using WordPress REST API. A specific interface was created for curators to use at the museum within Wordpress. Afterwards the application would pull data from Wordpress and display it.

This project was constantly in rapid prototype/development mode and was more to see what features the museum would want, thus the code isn't production quality.

Features we were looking to add: AR, Bluetooth Beacon Tracking. Due to technology advancements and security Bluetooth Beacons were not an option during testing, rather a seperate prototype using Cordova was going to be implemented. AR was starting to be in development via Apple Web VR.

Also implementation of service workers was next on the agenda (to make it an actual PWA)
